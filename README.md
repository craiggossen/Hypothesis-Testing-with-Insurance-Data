# Hypothesis Testing with Insurance Data
 
**The hypothesis testing within the project file looks at three questions:**

*1. Do smokers have higher insurance charges than non-smokers?*

This hypothesis test utilized 2 samples/groups being the individual's smoking status (yes/no) and their insurance charges.

It was determined the null hypothesis of *The insurance charges are the same regardless of smoking status* was rejected as there is a significant difference between the groups.

*2. Are men more likely to smoke than women?*

This hypothesis test utilized categorical data with 4 samples/groups to be compared. A chi-square hypothesis test was used. 

It was determined the null hypothesis of *A person's sex does not influence whether they will be a smoker or non smoker* was rejected as there is a significant difference between the groups.

*3. Do different regions have different charges, on average?*

This hypothesis test utilized categorical data with 8 samples/groups to be compared. ANOVA and Tukey was used. 

It was determined the null hypothesis of *A person's region does not influence their charge* was rejected as there is a significant difference between the southeast and southwest regions.
